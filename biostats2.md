# Machine Learning for Life Sciences

This national course is for PhD students, researchers, and university staff in Sweden who want to deepen their skills in biostatistics and machine learning for life sciences. The course builds on basic concepts like hypothesis testing and PCA and moves into more advanced topics. We will cover methods for analyzing complex life science data, including techniques beyond PCA for reducing data dimensions, mixed-effects models for repeated measures, and survival analysis. We will explore classification methods, ensemble techniques, optimization strategies, and PLS methods for analyzing single and multi-omics data. The focus is on practical applications, helping participants apply these tools to real biological datasets.

- Machine Learning Workflow: understand and implement core ML stages in R and Python, covering data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
- Dimension Reduction: understand and apply advanced techniques like UMAP and t-SNE for high-dimensional data analysis and understand their relationship to PCA.
- Classification Models: implement and tune RF, SVM, and logistic regression models using grid search for classification tasks.
- Ensemble Methods: understand concepts of bagging, boosting, and stacking, and apply AdaBoost and XGBoost for classification and regression tasks.
- PLS Analysis: Implement PLS, PLS-DA, and sPLS for single- and multi-omics data, including variable selection.
- Mixed Effects Models: apply mixed models to complex biological data, focusing on repeated measures and longitudinal designs.
- Survival Analysis: understand censored data, calculate Kaplan-Meier estimators to estimate survival functions, compare survival curves, and perform regression analysis with Cox proportional hazards models, handling time-dependent covariates and competing risks.
- Gain foundational knowledge of CNNs and RNNs; understand LLMs in life sciences and apply pre-trained models for cell-type classification and gene expression prediction.
- Integration Challenge: synthesize course methods in a final challenge, implementing ML workflows and statistical models on real-world data.

- In this course we focus on an **active learning approach**. We alternate between lectures, live coding sessionns, exercises and group discussions.

- While we focus on biostatistics and machine learning, not coding, some coding is needed and the examples used are in **R** and **Python** programming langugages. See below for entry requriements.

## <img border="0" src="assets/icons/enter.svg" width="40" height="40"> Entry requirements
- Having basic knowledge of descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing and linear regression or having attended the [Introduction to Biostatistics and Machine Learning course](biostats1.html).
- Basic R and Python data science skills 
- BYOL (bring your own laptop) with R and Python installed.

### More on R skills
- using R as calculator
- being able to work with vectors and matrices, incl. subsetting and matrices multiplication 
- reading in data from .csv files, e.g. with read_csv()
- printing top few rows or last few rows, e.g. with head() and tail()
- using in-built summary functions such as sum(), min() or max()
- being able to use documentation pages for R functions, e.g. with help() or ?()
- using if else statements, writing simple loops and functions.
- making simple plots (scatter plots, histograms), both with plot() and ggplot()
- using tidyverse() for data transformations, e.g. filtering rows, selecting columns, creating new columns etc. 
- being able to install CRAN packages e.g. with install.packages()
- being familiar with R Markdown or Quatro format

### More on Python skills
- familiarity with Python syntax, loops, functions
- numerical operations with NumPy for array and matrix computations
- data manipulation with pandas
- being able to visualise data using matplotlib and seaborn

## <img border="0" src="assets/icons/selection.svg" width="40" height="40"> Selection criteria

- Due to limited space the course can accommodate maximum of **24** participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the course as well as gender and geographical balance.
- We prioritise academic participants (students, staff, affiliated researchers) in Sweden. We welcome participants from industry and/or outside Sweden if there are seats available and the requirements criteria are met.

## <img border="0" src="assets/icons/fees.svg" width="40" height="40"> Fees

- 3000 SEK for academic participants
- 15 000 SEK for non-academic participants
- *the fee includes lunches and coffee*

## <img border="0" src="assets/icons/diploma.svg" width="40" height="40"> Course credits

- Upon successful course completion, assessed based on active participation in all course session, we will issue a course certificate.

- Please note that we are not able to provide any formal university credits (högskolepoäng). Many universities, however, recognize the attendance in our courses, and award 1.5 HPs, corresponding to 40h of studying. It is up to participants to clarify and arrange credit transfer with the relevant university department.
