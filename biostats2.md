## Machine Learning for Life Sciences

This national course is for PhD students, researchers, and university staff in Sweden who want to deepen their skills in biostatistics and machine learning for life sciences. The course builds on basic concepts like hypothesis testing and PCA and moves into more advanced topics. We will cover methods for analyzing complex life science data, including techniques beyond PCA for reducing data dimensions, mixed-effects models for repeated measures, and survival analysis. We will explore classification methods, ensemble techniques, optimization strategies, and PLS methods for analyzing single and multi-omics data. The focus is on practical applications, helping participants apply these tools to real biological datasets.
