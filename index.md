Welcome to our landing page for week-long biostatistics and machine learning courses!

- **For who?** For PhD students, researches, and university staff in Sweden who analyze life science research data.
- **By whom?** By NBIS, SciLifeLab bioinformatics platform, Sweden.
- **Where?** At Uppsala Biomedical Centre, Uppsala, Sweden.

Currently, we run two courses, a basic one, Introduction to Biostatistics and Machine Learning, and more advanced one, Machine Learning for Life Sciences.

## [Introduction to Biostatistics and Machine Learning](biostats1.html)

National course open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within all Swedish universities. The course is geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods. It would also suit those already applying biostatistical methods but have never got a chance to truly understand the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value.

## [Machine Learning for Life Sciences](biostats2.html)

This national course is for PhD students, researchers, and university staff in Sweden who want to deepen their skills in biostatistics and machine learning for life sciences. The course builds on basic concepts like hypothesis testing and PCA and moves into more advanced topics. We will cover methods for analyzing complex life science data, including techniques beyond PCA for reducing data dimensions, mixed-effects models for repeated measures, and survival analysis. We will explore classification methods, ensemble techniques, optimization strategies, and PLS methods for analyzing single and multi-omics data. The focus is on practical applications, helping participants apply these tools to real biological datasets.
